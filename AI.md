Take the role of a game designer for a whimsical, mystical, pop culture based space rpg.
The main character is a little kid in a spaceship with a crew that is on the search for his family members.
Create an Event using the following TypeScript definition

```typescript
// Define the event structure
type RewardAnswer = {
    choice: string;
    reward: string;
};

type RewardEvent = {
    description: string;
    question: string;
    answers: {good: RewardAnswer, neutral: RewardAnswer, bad: RewardAnswer};
}
type Answer = {
    choice: string;
    followUpQuestion: RewardEvent;
};

type Event = {
    description: string;
    question: string;
    answers: {good: Answer, neutral: Answer, bad: Answer};
};
```

In the followUpQuestion relate to the answer given in the first question.
The event should take place on a grass planet

```typescript
const event1: Event = {

Creating a TypeScript file for the event you described involves defining the decision tree and structures in code. Here's a TypeScript file that models the event:

    ```typescript
// Define the event structure
type Question = {
text: string;
answers: Answer[];
};

type Answer = {
text: string;
followUpQuestion?: Question;
};

// Define the event tree
const eventTree: Question = {
text: "What's your approach to the Cosmic Carnival?",
answers: [
{
text: "You decide to embrace the festivities with open arms, hoping to enjoy every delightful surprise.",
followUpQuestion: {

// Sample usage of the event tree
const playerChoice = eventTree.answers[0]; // For example, the player chooses the first answer
console.log(playerChoice.text);

if (playerChoice.followUpQuestion) {
// Present the follow-up question and answer options to the player
console.log(playerChoice.followUpQuestion.text);
playerChoice.followUpQuestion.answers.forEach((answer, index) => {
console.log(`${index + 1}. ${answer.text}`);
});
}
```

This TypeScript code defines the event's decision tree using a structure of questions and answers. It models the event's structure and allows you to simulate the player's choices and interactions within the event. You can expand upon this structure and integrate it into your game's logic as needed.

I'll try to create an event for your game using the decision tree you provided. Here is what I came up with:

**Event: Space Pirates Attack**

You are cruising through the empty space with your crew, enjoying the view of the stars and planets. Suddenly, you receive a distress signal from a nearby ship. It seems that they are being attacked by space pirates and need your help. What do you do?

    - Question 1: Do you respond to the distress signal?

- Question 1.1: How do you fight the pirates?

- Answer Good Bad: You try to fight the pirates, but you are no match for them. They easily dodge your attacks and hit you with powerful lasers. Your ship is severely damaged and you lose control of it. You crash into the other ship and cause a massive explosion that kills everyone on board.
- Answer Neutral: You are not sure if you should help the ship or not. You decide to wait and see what happens. You watch from a safe distance as the pirate ship attacks the other vessel.
- Question 1.2: What happens next?
    - Answer Neutral Good: The pirate ship suddenly stops firing and starts to flee. It seems that they have spotted a bigger threat in the vicinity. You take this opportunity to contact the other ship and offer your assistance. The captain is relieved and grateful for your help.

- Answer Neutral Bad: The pirate ship overwhelms the other vessel and destroys it with a final blast. You see debris and bodies floating in space. You feel sorry for the victims, but also glad that you did not get involved. You hope that the pirates will not notice you.
- Answer Bad: You ignore the distress signal and continue your journey. You do not want to risk your life and your ship for some strangers. You think that they probably deserved their fate anyway.
- Question 1.3: What are the consequences of your choice?
    - Answer Bad Good: You avoid any trouble and reach your destination safely. You are happy with your decision and do not regret it at all. You think that you made the smart choice.
- Answer Bad Neutral: You encounter some minor problems along the way, but nothing serious. You are not too happy or too sad about your decision. You think that it was just another day in space.
- Answer Bad Bad: You are haunted by guilt and remorse for ignoring the distress signal. You wonder if you could have saved those people or if they had something important to tell you. You also hear rumors that the space pirates are looking for you and want revenge for leaving them without loot.
This is an interesting challenge. I will try to create an event for a whimsical, mystical, pop culture based space rpg using the decision tree you provided. Here is what I came up with:

**Event: The Black Hole Dilemma**

You are exploring the outer reaches of the galaxy, when you encounter a massive black hole that seems to be pulling everything around it into oblivion. You have three options:

    - Question 1: Do you want to investigate the black hole, avoid it, or try to use it as a shortcut?
    - Answer Good: Investigate the black hole. You are curious about the mysteries of the universe and want to learn more about this phenomenon. You approach the black hole carefully, scanning it with your sensors and looking for any signs of life or activity.
- Question 1.1: Do you detect anything unusual, nothing at all, or something dangerous?
    - Answer Good Good: You detect something unusual. You find a faint signal coming from inside the black hole, indicating that there might be a wormhole or a portal to another dimension. You decide to take a risk and enter the black hole, hoping to discover a new world.
- Answer Good Neutral: You detect nothing at all. The black hole is silent and empty, as far as you can tell. You feel a bit disappointed, but also relieved that you didn't encounter any trouble. You decide to leave the black hole and continue your exploration.
- Answer Good Bad: You detect something dangerous. You notice that the black hole is surrounded by a swarm of hostile aliens, who seem to be guarding it or worshiping it. They notice your presence and attack you, forcing you to fight or flee.
- Answer Neutral: Avoid the black hole. You are not interested in the black hole and prefer to stay away from it. You steer your ship around the black hole, keeping a safe distance and looking for other places to explore.
- Question 1.2: Do you find anything interesting, nothing at all, or something dangerous?
    - Answer Neutral Good: You find something interesting. You spot a nearby planet that looks habitable and inviting. You decide to land on the planet and explore its surface, hoping to find some resources or allies.
- Answer Neutral Neutral: You find nothing at all. The space around the black hole is barren and boring, with no planets, stars, or asteroids to see. You feel a bit bored, but also glad that you didn't encounter any trouble. You decide to move on and look for other destinations.
- Answer Neutral Bad: You find something dangerous. You encounter a rogue asteroid that is heading towards the black hole, dragging everything in its path with it. You realize that you are too close to escape its gravity and have to brace for impact.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   - Answer Bad: Try to use it as a shortcut. You are adventurous and reckless and want to see if you can use the black hole as a shortcut to another part of the galaxy. You accelerate your ship towards the black hole, hoping to survive the journey and end up somewhere else.
- Question 1.3: Do you succeed, fail, or end up somewhere worse?
    - Answer Bad Good: You succeed. You manage to pass through the black hole unharmed and emerge on the other side in a different sector of the galaxy. You are amazed by your luck and excited by the new possibilities.
- Answer Bad Neutral: You fail. You are unable to withstand the immense pressure and gravity of the black hole and your ship is crushed into oblivion. You die instantly and painlessly.
- Answer Bad Bad: You end up somewhere worse. You survive the black hole, but end up in a hostile and inhospitable part of the galaxy, where you are attacked by pirates, monsters, or worse. You regret your decision and wish you had never entered the black hole.

I will try to generate the full event with every decision path. Here is the event:

    You are flying through a space nebula when you encounter a swarm of space pirates. They demand that you surrender your cargo and your ship, or they will blast you to pieces. You have three options:

    - Fight back and try to escape

- You are overwhelmed by the pirates and they destroy your ship. You die in a fiery explosion. You feel nothing. Game over.
- Negotiate with them and offer a part of your cargo
- If you choose this option, you will have to bargain with the pirates and try to reach a deal that satisfies both parties. You will need to use your charisma, intelligence, and luck to succeed. The possible outcomes are:
    - You convince the pirates to accept a fair trade and they let you go peacefully. You feel relieved and satisfied. You lose some resources but gain some reputation.

                         - If you choose this option, you will have to give up your cargo and your ship, and hope that the pirates will spare your life. You will need to use your courage, dignity, and luck to survive. The possible outcomes are:

- The pirates take your cargo and your ship, but they mock your surrender and torture you for fun. They leave you alive, but in pain and misery. They dump you on a barren planet with no hope of rescue. You feel ashamed and broken. Game over.
- The pirates take your cargo and your ship, but they show no mercy and kill you anyway. They laugh at your weakness and forget about you. You feel nothing. Game over.

    What will you do?


    I will try to create another event with more description and less game over endings. Here is the event:

    You are exploring a space station that was abandoned by its previous inhabitants. You are curious about what happened to them and what secrets they left behind. You have three options:

    - Search the station for clues and artifacts

You also encounter some traps and enemies that were left behind. You feel intrigued and challenged. You gain some resources and knowledge, but also take some damage.

- Hack the station's main computer and access its data
- If you choose this option, you will have to hack the station's main computer and access its data. You will need to use your intelligence, technology, and luck to succeed. The possible outcomes are:

- Leave the station and look for another place to explore
- If you choose this option, you will have to leave the station and look for another place to explore. You will need to use your intuition, navigation, and luck to find something interesting. The possible outcomes are:
    - You leave the station and find a nearby asteroid field that contains some rare minerals and crystals. You also encounter a friendly miner who offers to trade with you. You feel lucky and happy. You gain some resources and a new ally.
